                Stomatopod crustaceans (mantis shrimps) possess an incredibly complex visual system, comprised of compound eyes that contain more types of photoreceptors than in any other known animal. The mantis shrimp eye’s optical arsenal includes monocular range finding capability, 12-channel colour vision, 2 channel linear polarization detection, and, in some species, the ability to detect and analyze circularly polarized light. Underlying this unparalleled array of functional capabilities is a structural diversification of a basic photoreceptive unit common to all compound eyes the ommatidium. In the following, the mantis shrimps visual prowess is described in the context of the design variations and the distribution of its ommatidia.
                Mantis Shrimps shows the eye of the scaly-tailed mantis, Lysiosquilla scabricauda. It consists of upper and lower (dorsal and ventral) hemispheres separated by a narrow central band. A close examination of the eye’s surface reveals that each region consists of closely-spaced parallel rows of facets tiny ones in the hemispheres and much larger ones in the band. The hemispheres have many rows of facets but the band has only six. Looking beneath the surface reveals that each facet is the tip of an elongate structural unit, known as an ommatidium. All ommatidia are optically sensitive devices, but those in the band are the most complex, most functional, and most interesting.
